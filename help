<h2>Supported operating systems</h2>
<hr>
<p>Ubuntu 18.04 Bionic,<br>
Ubuntu 17.10 Artful,<br>
Ubuntu 16.04 Xenial,<br>
Linux Mint 18.X and<br>
Linux Mint 19.X.</p>
<p>For other operating systems based on Ubuntu please install <a href="apt://gedit">Gedit</a>.</p>
<p>Operating systems which are not mentioned here are not tested. Deb Cup need not work properly with them.</p>
<h2>Set fingerprint</h2>
<hr>
<p>A GPG key is needed when you want to sign a dsc and changes and upload them to a PPA.</p>
<p>If you have just one GPG key, you need not set a fingerprint. Deb Cup will find your GPG key automatically.</p>
<p>If you have more GPG keys, maybe you want to choose one of them. You can do that in this setting. Otherwise Deb Cup will use one of your GPG keys.</p>  
<p>If you have not a GPG key, see the chapter Create signed dsc and changes.</p>
<h2>Set user and ppa</h2>
<hr>
<p>You need a functional ppa. See <a href="https://help.launchpad.net/Packaging/PPA">https://help.launchpad.net/Packaging/PPA</a>.<br>
If you have more ppas, change this setting before uploading.</p>
<h2>Choose a project folder</h2>
<hr>
<p>Choose a folder with the source code. The name of the folder have to be in format name-version, e.g. myapp-0.1.0.<p>
<p>Only lower case, numbers, dot and dash are accepted as the name.</p>
<h2>Create/Open the debian folder</h2>
<hr>
<p>If a debian folder do not exist, Deb Cup create one. Then a default file browser will be opened. Edit this folder manually according to your source code. See<br>
<a href="https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/maint-guide/dreq.en.html">https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/maint-guide/dreq.en.html</a><br>
If a debian folder exist, Deb Cup opens it only.</p>
<h2>Create orig tarball</h2>
<hr>
<p>Deb Cup packs your source code to the archive project_version.orig.tar.xz. This is needed for creating deb packages and creating signed dsc and changes.</p>
<h2>Increment changelog</h2>
<hr>
<p>When you want to create the deb package or signed dsc and changes, changelog file in the debian folder have to be actualized. The name and version of your project have to be the same as the name of the folder with the source code.</p>
<p>When a changelog is incremented a new entry is added. A release in the new entry is UNRELEASED. Leave the changelog unreleased. A release will be set when a deb package or signed dsc and changes are creating.  
<p>A version in the last changelog file entry cannot be lower then the version in the previous entry.</p>
<p>Maintainer name and email is taken from the debian/control Maintainer field.</p>
<h2>Create deb binary</h2>
<hr>
<p>The changelog file will be opened. Check it and save.</p>
<br>
<h4>Troubleshooting</h4>
<p>When creation of a deb package is aborted because of unexpected source changes, create new orig tarball.</p>
<h2>Create signed dsc and changes</h2>
<hr>
<p>The changelog file will be opened. Check it and save.</p>
<p>When you want to create signed dsc and changes, you must have a GPG key. You can create one when you are activating your PPA. See<br>
<a href="https://help.launchpad.net/Packaging/PPA#Activating_a_PPA">https://help.launchpad.net/Packaging/PPA#Activating_a_PPA</a></p>
<p> For import of an existing secret key from a backup use gpg --import secring.gpg in the folder with the key.</p>
<br>
<h4>Troubleshooting</h4>
<p>When creation of signed dsc and changes is aborted because of unexpected source changes, create new orig tarball.</p>
